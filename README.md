# How Does It Works?

Every 3 seconds, the program will tick the binance API to know the values of selected assets.
If you want to add other ones to be ticked, you just enter the asset name in the input fiel and click on add.
A new row will be generated in the window and the value of this crypto will be shown in canadian dollars value.
